=================================

`Documentation <https://yura52.github.io/delu>`_

.. __INCLUDE_0__

**DeLU is a simple well-documented PyTorch toolbox**
consisting of two parts:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 35
   :header-rows: 0

   * - ``delu.{cuda,nn,random,utils.data}``
     - Extensions to the corresponding ``torch.{...}`` submodules.
   * - ``delu.tools``
     - Handy tools for common scenarios (e.g. for training loops).

**Project status** üß™
*Until the release of the version 0.1.0, DeLU should be considered as experimental.
All changes are carefully documented in the release notes.*

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: none

    pip install delu

Usage
-----

*DeLU is a toolbox, not a framework,
so you can learn things and start using them in any order.*

The "Usage & API" section on the website
is the main source of knowledge about DeLU:
it provides usage examples, explanations and docstrings.
