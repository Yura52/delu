DeLU is a minimalistic PyTorch toolbox (not a "framework"):

- DeLU provides functions and classes facilitating training loops, reproducibility,
  tensor manipulations and other typical aspects of PyTorch projects.
- In DeLU, many things will ðŸ§¡ **immediately feel familiar to PyTorch users** ðŸ§¡,
  and the rest is simple and well-documented.
- There is no need to "rebuild your project around DeLU":
  you can start using DeLU by picking individual tools that you find helpful.

*DeLU is tested and battle-tested in real projects.*
