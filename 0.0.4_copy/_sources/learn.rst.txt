How to install Zero?
--------------------

For installation instructions, see :ref:`Installation <installation>`.

What is API Reference?
----------------------

API Reference (see the sidebar) is the main source of knowledge about the library. It
contains everything you may need: API specification, tutorials and usage examples.

How to learn Zero?
------------------

Zero, by design, is rather a "toolbox" than a "framework", so you can learn things and
start using them in almost any order. If you want to explore the library by yourself,
just browse the API Reference.

However, if you want to quickly learn "the most important" things, then understanding of
`this classification task <https://github.com/Yura52/zero/blob/master/examples/mnist.py>`_
is enough. To achieve this, you need to walk through some specific parts of Reference
paying attention to *explanations* and *examples*, without diving into API details. Here
are the things to learn:

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   zero.Stream
   zero.evaluation
   zero.improve_reproducibility
   zero.random
   zero.ProgressTracker
   zero.Timer
   zero.hardware.get_gpus_info
   zero.concat

Congratulations! You are ready to apply Zero in practice.
